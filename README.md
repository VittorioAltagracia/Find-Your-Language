# Development is on-pause. I will most likely rebuild it or refactor the whole thing.

# Find-Your-Language
### Please view the 'Fetching-data-from-a-database' branch for the latest code.

This project is designed to help you choose a new language to learn. It is a hybrid between a game and an online article page.

### As of January this project is on pause due to my school curriculum at the NuCamp coding bootcamp. I am hoping to resume development this year and apply some of new tools and techniques I've learned. This was one of my first solo projects, where I was practicing JS, CSS, and HTML but now I can't wait to finish it!
