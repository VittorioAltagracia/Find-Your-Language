This projects is designed to help you choose a new language to learn. It is a hybrid between a game and an online article page.

# As of January this project is on pause due to my school curriculum at the NuCamp coding bootcamp. I am hoping to resume development this year and apply some of new tools and techniques I've learned. This was one of my first solo projects, where I was practicing JS, CSS and HTML but now I can't wait to finish it!
